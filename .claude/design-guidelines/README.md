# UI Design Skill

A comprehensive skill for creating modern, professional user interfaces that avoid generic AI aesthetics.

## 🎯 What This Skill Does

Transforms generic UI code into production-ready, professional designs by enforcing:

- **8px Grid System** - Consistent, harmonious spacing
- **Neutral Color Foundation** - Grays + one accent color (no rainbow gradients)
- **Readable Typography** - Minimum 16px body text, clear hierarchy
- **Subtle Elevation** - Professional shadows, not heavy or overdone
- **Complete Interactive States** - Hover, active, focus, disabled for all elements
- **Mobile-First Design** - Responsive layouts that work everywhere
- **Professional Polish** - Avoids generic purple/blue gradients

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Install the skill:**
   - Upload `ui-design.skill` in Claude.ai Settings → Skills

2. **Start building:**
   ```
   "Create a landing page for a SaaS product"
   "Build a signup form"
   "Design a dashboard with stats cards"
   ```

3. **Watch it work:**
   - Automatically applies all design principles
   - References examples as needed
   - Generates clean, professional code
   - Includes complete interactive states

## ✨ Key Features

### Automatic Best Practices
Every UI component includes:
- ✅ Consistent 8px grid spacing
- ✅ Minimum 16px body text
- ✅ Neutral base + one accent color
- ✅ Hover/active/focus/disabled states
- ✅ Mobile-responsive design
- ✅ Accessible contrast ratios
- ✅ Subtle shadows and elevation
- ✅ Clear typography hierarchy

### What It Prevents
- ❌ Purple-to-blue gradients (generic AI aesthetic)
- ❌ Rainbow color schemes
- ❌ Inconsistent spacing (random values like 15px, 22px)
- ❌ Tiny unreadable text
- ❌ Missing interactive states
- ❌ Heavy shadows and overdone effects
- ❌ Cramped layouts

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

**Clean & Minimal**
- Embrace white space
- Remove unnecessary elements
- Let content breathe

**Neutral Foundation**
- 90% grays and off-whites
- 10% accent color for emphasis
- Professional, not flashy

**Consistent Spacing**
- Everything on 8px grid
- Creates visual harmony
- Improves readability

**Clear Hierarchy**
- Typography scale
- Color differentiation
- Proper spacing

## 📊 Before & After

### Before (Generic AI Output)
```jsx
<button className="px-2 py-1 bg-gradient-to-r from-purple-500 to-blue-500 text-xs">
  Click
</button>
```
Problems: Rainbow gradient, tiny text (12px), cramped padding, no states

### After (UI Design Skill)
```jsx
<button className="px-6 py-3 bg-blue-600 text-white rounded-lg hover:bg-blue-700 active:bg-blue-800 transition-colors shadow-sm">
  Click
</button>
```
Improvements: Single accent, readable text (16px), proper padding, complete states

## 📚 Documentation

**In the skill:**
- SKILL.md - Core principles and patterns
- component-examples.md - Detailed examples with comparisons
- color-palettes.md - Color schemes and guidelines
- spacing-system.md - Complete spacing reference

**In the outputs:**
- usage-guide.md - How to use the skill
- before-after-comparison.md - Visual transformations
- demo-landing-page.jsx - Complete example

## 🔧 Customization

The skill has strong opinions for good reason, but you can customize:

```
"Use teal as the accent color"
"Make it extra minimal"
"Use tighter spacing for this dashboard"
"Apply serif fonts for headings"
```

Core quality principles remain while adapting to your needs.

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Be specific:** "Create a button" vs "Create primary, secondary, and danger buttons"
2. **Mention preferences:** "Use emerald as accent" or "Extra large spacing"
3. **Ask for variations:** "Show me both shadow and border card styles"
4. **Reference the docs:** "Show me the color palette options"

## 🎓 Learning Resources

Ask Claude to show you:
- "Examples of good button design from the skill"
- "What color palettes are available?"
- "How should I space sections on a landing page?"
- "Show me the spacing system reference"

All reference files are loaded on-demand when needed.

## 🏆 Quality Standards

Every component meets:
- WCAG AA contrast ratios
- 48px minimum touch targets on mobile
- Keyboard navigation support
