# Testing the router is a little bit different from testing other services.
# On other services, all is manages in one docker-compose.yml, but
# on the router, since it's a single instalce per server it has separate
# docker-compose.yml. You should docker compose up -d this file and then
# go to the client (./craftkidstoys/) and run the docker compose up -d 
# there also.
